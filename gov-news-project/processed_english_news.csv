He highlighted the cultural significance of 'Sindoor' and lauded PM Modi's response to the terror. Quoting his father's poem, Bachchan urged relentless fight against injustice, praising the army's action and the symbolic restoration of respect for women, led by female officers.Amitabh Bachchan has maintained silence on social media ever since the Pahalgam attack. He has penned a long note about it on his blog, thus expressing his feelings in depth. India launched âOperation Sindoorâ as its fight against the terrorist attack, and Bachchan, on his blog, called this a brilliant thought. Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowHe further went on to explain the deep significance of âSindoorâ in our culture and why thus, this was just the right thing to do by PM Narendra Modi and the Indian Government.Operation SindoorAmid flare-up hours after thaw, officials say things will settle down with timeCeasefire on, but pressure stays: Key decisions by India against Pak that still stand'Will work with India &amp; Pakistan to seek solution on Kashmir': TrumpBachchan began his thoughts in Hindi and he quoted his fatherâs poem, âà¤¤à¥ à¤¨à¤¾ à¤¥à¤®à¥à¤ à¤à¤¾ à¤à¤­à¥ ; à¤¤à¥ à¤¨ à¤®à¥à¤¡à¤¼à¥à¤à¤¾ à¤à¤­à¥âHe further expressed his thoughts at length. The actor wrote, âThe innocent couple on a vacation holiday in Pahalgam , was attacked by terrorists, posing as Tourist guides .. they pulled them out in the open, asked the Husband to pull his pants down, and when he saw that he was not circumcised, a traditional religious procedure in Muslim men, he told him recite the Kalma .. when the man a Hindu did not know, he set up to shoot him .. his Wife fell at his feet and said do not kill him .. but he mercilessly shot him, and made the Wife a widow in front of her eyes .. the Wife then begged this monster, this demon, to kill her also .. this devil of a man said : âI won't kill you .. you go and tell Modi .."" !!""Feeling immensely for the unspeakable grief of the widow, her mental state and her absolute destruction .. I suddenly remembered a line from one of my Father's poem :... and this I built ..the wife went to Modi and said : this is the line from that poem ..""à¤¹à¥ à¤à¤¿à¤¤à¤¾ à¤à¥ à¤°à¤¾à¤ à¤à¤° à¤®à¥à¤ à¤®à¤¾à¤à¤à¤¤à¥ , à¤¸à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥à¤° à¤¦à¥à¤¨à¤¿à¤¯à¤¾ !! the ashes of the funeral pyre are in my hands and the World is asking for sindoor ..Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowâHe added, âwhen the Widowed Wife went to Modi with open hands and spoke those words that I have quoted of Babuji , he replied ""go .. i have given Sindoor .."" !!! This is a symbolic word build .. What happened with the Wife at the time of the killing and the words and incident writing earlier is real ..""Bachchan further explained the significance of âSindoorâ in the Hindu religion and said, âSINDOOR in our religion is a ritual during the marriage ceremony when the to be Husband, puts the red vermillion on the parting of the to be Wife .. the parting in the hair which is made in the middle of her forehead .. in Hindi it is called 'maang' à¤®à¤¾à¤à¤ .. it is an extremely pious moment .. and the Wife wears the 'sindoor ' throughout her life .. its a symbol of marriage and respect ..If the husband dies before the wife's death , the Wife wipes off the red vermillion from her parting .. and it is a most sad and emotional moment .. Sindoor being the symbol of dedication respect protection immortally .. prized and displayed with pride , assiduity , commitment , sedulousnessâThus, he called âOperation Sindoorâ a brilliant thought. âThe Pahalgam attack where they killed 26 innocent tourists .. all with their families enjoying a holiday , mercilessly, at one spot - even on a couple just married three days ago, who had come for their Honeymoon .. will never be forgotten .. SO ..the Government , who have been telling the neighbouring authorities to stop terrorist camps and activities in our Country , has never been heeded .. Hence Modi and the Government decided to respond to the terrorist base camps in the neighbours and launched a military procedure .. the results of which are well known .. 9 of their terrorist camps and outfits were destroyed .. militarily .."" He added, âBrilliant thought .. it signified that the demons wiped out the sindoor from the the married women, made them widows and India through the attack and naming it Operation Sindoor signified symbolically that we shall fight to restore it .. and they did ..AND here is the best part .. Two personnel from the Indian Army, were chosen to give a title to the Operation ..You know who they were ..? They were two Women Officers ..A Colonel in the Armed forces and the other a Wing Commander in the Air Force .. âBachchan further appreciated our Armed Forces and inspired them to keep going and fighting as he explained why he quoted this poem âAgneepathâ by his father which he started off with. He said, âAnd I chose to select words from it : as an inspiration and a demand to the Army and all Indians .. to continue the fight !! Against the injustice done to us and in particular the innocent .. !!! "" you shall never stop .. you shall never turn back .. you shall never bend ..Path of Fire ! Path of Fire !

Even though she was in a state of shock and couldn't process what had happened, she was quick to take the first available flight to Chennai to stay with her family. In this challenging ordeal, she met a few fans who approached her for a photo.Samantha explained the out-of-the-world experience, stating,âI never refuse pictures because they are the people who shaped you into what you are today. I remember last month in December, I received a morning call from my mother that my dad has passed away. I had to fly out on the first flight out of Mumbai to Chennai and I was in shock because I had not talked to my dad in a long time."" . I was sort of paralyzed on the plane with no response and I recall there were a lot of people who requested my photo and I recall standing up and taking all these photos and smiling.âThe weight of public expectationsSamantha discussed the special burdens of being a celebrity, citing that fans have no idea what personal demons celebrities might be going through.

Despite mixed reviews and weekday drops, the film maintains a steady performance, particularly in Tamil Nadu, with the Tamil version contributing the bulk of the earnings. The film's strengths lie in its filmmaking flair, Suriya's performance, and Santhosh Narayanan's music.Suriyaâs latest outing âRetroâ, directed by Karthik Subbaraj, continues its steady run at the box office, surpassing Rs 54 crore in collections within nine days of release.Retro Movie ReviewDecent day wise collectionsAccording to early estimates from the Sacnilk website, the film earned Rs 1.35 crore (India net) on its second Friday, taking its total domestic collection to â¹54.12 crore across all languages.Operation SindoorIndia's air defence systems shoot down Pak drones in J&amp;K, Punjab &amp; RajasthanIndia-Pakistan tensions: Delhi airport issues travel advisoryOperation Sindoor: Multiple explosions heard at several Pakistan air basesTired of too many ads?go ad free nowVarun, Mrunal & Pooja Turn Heads at London Retro ScreeningGood buzz, strong openingThe film opened strong on its first Thursday with Rs 19.25 crore, largely driven by Suriyaâs star power and high pre-release expectations. While collections dipped significantly on Day 2 to Rs 7.75 crore, the film managed to hold reasonably well over the first weekend, collecting Rs 8 crore and Rs 8.15 crore on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. However, weekdays saw a noticeable drop, with earnings sliding to Rs 3.4 crore on Monday and continuing to decline through the week.Despite mixed critical reception and a visible drop in collections during weekdays, âRetroâ has maintained its pace through steady performance in Tamil Nadu and decent footfalls in Telugu states. The Tamil version contributed the bulk of earnings, with over Rs 47 crore in the first week alone.PollDid the film's strong opening surprise you?No, I expected itYes, very surprisingTamil Occupancy recorded at 18.40 percentOn Day 9 (May 9, 2025), Retro recorded an overall 18.40% Tamil occupancy, with the highest turnout in night shows (24.30%). Telugu occupancy, comparatively lower, stood at 10.20%, with a gradual build-up from morning to night shows.Our verdictETimes gave the film a rating of 3 stars out of 5 and our official review read, âKarthik Subbaraj manages to make us overlook all these reservations with sheer filmmaking flair. A 15-minute single-shot sequence that involves song and dance, heated conversation and tense action just makes one want to stand up and applaud. Tired of too many ads?go ad free nowSimilarly, an action scene in a bioluminescent sea makes for striking visuals (Shreyaas Krishna is the cinematographer). Then there's Suriya, whose very presence lights up the frames. The actor's performance, too, feels more organic when compared to some of his recent works where there was a certain artifice creeping into the acting. Then, there's Santhosh Narayanan, who delivers foot-tapping numbers and a rousing background score that elevates even the weaker moments. If only had the writing been more focused in the latter portions, Retro could have escaped the curse of the second half, and turned into something truly memorable.âCheck out our list of the latest Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada movies.

It operates on 'Fire and Forget Principle', adopting a variety of flights on its way to the target.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementIndia Today News DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 11, 2025 15:44 ISTEdited By: Priya PareekIn ShortNew BrahMos Integration and Testing Facility inaugurated in LucknowBrahMos is a supersonic cruise missile with over 450 km rangeMissile operates on 'Fire and Forget' principle with high precisionUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath confirmed on Sunday that a BrahMos missile was used in strikes against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor. He was speaking at the inauguration event of BrahMos Aerospace Integration and Testing Facility in Lucknow. The new facility will give a boost to India's defence capabilities.""You must have seen a glimpse of the BrahMos missile during Operation Sindoor. If you didn't, then just ask the people of Pakistan about the power of the BrahMos missile,"" he said.advertisementWHAT IS BRAHMOS?BrahMos is a long-range supersonic cruise missile known for its high accuracy. It operates on 'Fire and Forget Principle', adopting a variety of flights on its way to the target. Its destructive power is enhanced due to large kinetic energy on impact. The two-stage missile features a solid propellant booster in the first stage that propels it to supersonic speed before detaching. The second stage, a liquid ramjet engine, carries the missile to speeds nearing Mach 3 during the cruise phase.The missile, equipped with stealth technology and an advanced guidance system with embedded software, is designed for precision and survivability.BraHmos maintains a range of up to 290 km and supersonic velocity throughout its flight. It ensures reduced flight time, higher target accuracy, and minimal chances of interception by existing defense systems.advertisementIts high impact force is bolstered by significant kinetic energy, while it can cruise at altitudes of up to 15 km and strike as low as 10 meters. The missile carries a conventional warhead weighing between 200 and 300 kg.WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT BRAHMOS?BrahMos Capabilities:Range: Over 450 km (extended range variants up to 800 km reportedly tested)Speed: Supersonic (Mach 2.8–3.0), making interception highly difficultLaunch Platform: Air, land, sea, and submarine capable — the ALCM version is launched from Su-30MKIAccuracy: Near pinpoint precision with advanced guidance and navigationPayload: High-explosive warhead (200–300 kg), ideal for hardened targetsCompared to existing state-of-the-art subsonic cruise missiles, BraHmos has:3 times more velocity2.5 to 3 times more flight range3 to 4 times more seeker range9 times more kinetic energyBrahMos is the first supersonic cruise missile known to be in service. Induction of the first version of Brahmos weapon complex in the Indian Navy commenced from 2005 with INS Rajput as the first ship.The Indian Army has also inducted many BrahMos regiments since 2007.

A news report coming out of South Africa states that the banned drug that Rabada used was cocaine.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementKagiso Rabada tested positive for cocaine, claims report. (AP Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 11, 2025 15:21 ISTIn ShortKagiso Rabada reportedly tested positive for cocaine before SA20 competitionTim Paine criticised the secrecy around Rabada’s doping caseRabada declined a second sample test for the banned substanceKagiso Rabada, who returned to the Indian Premier League after serving a short doping ban, was originally tested positive for cocaine, reported South African publication Rapport. Rabada, who is one of the best fast bowlers of his generation, reportedly used cocaine ahead of the SA20 competition.Rabada, who plays for Gujarat Titans, exited the Indian Premier League on April 3, a week into this year's competition. The franchise cited that Rabada was back home due to personal reasons and did not divulge any further details.advertisementIt was announced on May 5 that Rabada would be returning to the IPL after serving a short doping ban. And only on Saturday, May 10, Rapport and News24 reported that the drug that Rabada had consumed pre-SA20 was cocaine. According to the sources quoted by both reports, Rabada’s lawyers were able to prove that the fast bowler did not use cocaine during the SA20 competition, as the concentration of benzoylecgonine (BZE), a metabolite of cocaine, was less than 1,000 nanograms per millilitre.The Rapport report also claimed that Rabada had declined the option of having a second sample tested.FANS DESERVE TO KNOW: TIM PAINEAfter Rabada's news of the doping ban was made public in the first week of May, former Australia captain Tim Paine fumed over the short stint of the ban and the lack of transparency in the overall procedure. Paine had told SEN Radio that the fans deserved to know what substance Rabada had used which got him banned from all forms of cricket for a month.advertisementEarlier, it was also reported that Rabada's drug was a relaxing kind and not a performance -enhancing one.“Taking drugs – recreational or performance-enhancing – is not a personal issue that can just be hidden for a month. A guy can be taken out of the IPL, moved back to South Africa, and we just let it slide under the rug. Then we will bring him back once he’s already served his ban,"" Tim Paine had said in an interview.“Not only will he play against Australia in the World Test Championship, but he’s available to be playing now in the IPL. No one knew about what he’s taken, what he was given, or who the organising body was that oversaw it,"" he had added.“If he is going to take drugs and be caught doing it, I think people deserve to know what he’s taken, how long he is being rubbed out for, and who sanctioned it (the suspension). People need to be held to account for stuff like that,” concluded the former Australia captain.Stay updated on IPL 2025 with India Today!

Ahead of the upcoming tour of England, there have been several reports claiming that Kohli has expressed his desire to retire from Tests to BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India).advertisementSources have told India Today that a senior BCCI official has spoken to Virat Kohli, urging him to reconsider his decision. However, the batter seems firm on his decision and is reluctant to continue. Amid all this, a clip from an old interview of Kohli has been going viral on social media where Kohli is seen talking about how he wants a smooth transition in Indian cricket.“The reason why I reach out to these guys is because I don't want them to waste probably months and years of my life that I wasted as a youngster still trying to figure things out. When I found out the formula for success and what it means to compete at this level. I want these guys to pick it up early so that the transition with Indian cricket can be very smooth. It should not take youngsters 2 and 3 years after the seniors are gone to build the team again, so I want them up to speed immediately when we are, you know, almost about to step out, and Indian cricket stays on top,” said Kohli in a Sky Sports interview from 2021.advertisement Furthermore, Kohli also speaks about the challenges of playing Test cricket and mentions how every day is a challenge.India vs Sri Lanka Tri series final Updates“Test cricket is tough. I mean, even when you're you're one of the top teams in the world or probably the best test team in the world over the last few years. You can still go into a space where you probably don't want it. At certain stages you feel like, ‘5 days, do I want to do this again?’, so you really need to be absolutely honest with yourself. Are you ready for the hard grind? Are you ready to wake up on day 3 when things are absolutely stacked up against you, when you know that you are in trouble, as a batting unit? Are you going out there to get that 100 or get that 150 for your team? You know it's going to be tough. You probably have to do it for 5-6 hours over a period of 2 days. Are you strong enough to do that?,” he added.What Test cricket means to Virat Kohli pic.twitter.com/Db1NYletyK— Sky Sports Cricket (@SkyCricket) May 10, 2025Kohli has scored 9230 runs from 123 Test matches at an average of 46.85 with 30 centuries and 31 fifties. He's 770 runs away from completing the landmark of 10000 runs and becoming just the 16th player to achieve the feat in Tests.

In a post on X, he said, ""The Indian National Congress reiterates its demand for an all-party meet chaired by the PM and for a special session of Parliament for a full discussion on Pahalgam, Operation Sindoor, and the ceasefire announcements made from Washington DC first and then subsequently by the Governments of India and Pakistan"".Ramesh said the Congress considers that the mention of ""neutral site"" by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio for dialogue between India and Pakistan raises many questions.""Have we abandoned the Simla Agreement? Have we opened the doors to third-party mediation?"" he askedadvertisement""The Indian National Congress would like to ask if diplomatic channels between India and Pakistan are being reopened? What commitments have we sought and got?,"" he asked.The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Saturday said there was no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place.This statement came after US Secretary of State Rubio said ""the governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.""The Congress leader also referred to reported remarks of two former army chiefs V P Malik and Manoj Narwane on the understanding reached between India and Pakistan, and said they demand answers from the prime minister himself.""Finally, the Indian National Congress believes it is but natural for the country to recall Indira Gandhi for her extraordinarily courageous and resolute leadership in 1971,"" Ramesh said.In another post, the Congress leader said, On November 9, 1981, the IMF approved a USD 5.8 billion loan to India.""The US had strong objections to it and had abstained from the Executive Board meeting. But Indira Gandhi was able to persuade the IMF that the loan was necessary for India to be able to deal with the tripling of oil prices.advertisement""On Feb 29, 1984, when Pranab Mukherjee presented the Budget she had got him to announce that India had concluded the IMF programme successfully and that it was NOT drawing about USD 1.3 billion of the amount approved.

Deepika's win took India's overall medal tally to six at the event, with five coming from the compound section on Saturday that included a remarkable triple-medal haul by comeback archer Madhura Dhamangankar.In the bronze medal playoff, Deepika showed greater composure and tactical clarity than her defeat to Lim in the semis.The opening set ended in a 27-all tie, but Deepika edged ahead with a solid 28 in the second to take a 3-1 lead.Kang, a former world champion who had beaten Deepika in the Berlin World Cup quarterfinals back in 2017, fought back in the third, scoring a flawless 30 to Deepika’s 27 to make it three-all.advertisementBut the Indian responded with her best shooting under pressure, firing three perfect arrows for 30 in the fourth set to again take a 5-3 lead.Needing just a draw in the final set to secure victory, Deepika delivered once more, shooting 29 to Kang's 28, to bag the bronze.Earlier, Deepika began nervously in the semifinal, losing the first set 26-27 despite hitting two 9s.The second set saw both archers shoot 28, but Lim held steady to force a split and deny Deepika any rhythm.The reigning world No. 1 then shifted into top gear, drilling in a perfect 30 in the third set while Deepika managed 28.With momentum fully on her side, Lim wrapped up the match in the fourth with a 29, as Deepika's 28 once again fell short, sealing the match 7-1 in the Korean’s favour.It was a repeat of their 2023 clash, though Deepika had managed to take two set points back then.India are in fray for a second medal in the recurve section where Parth Salunkhe, who lost out to Korean legend Kim Woojin 4-6 in the men's semifinal, will play the bronze medal playoff.Published By: Debodinna ChakrabortyPublished On: May 11, 2025Also Read | Anahat, Abhay make

Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementThe decision is in line with CBSE’s broader goal of promoting holistic development in students, ensuring that they grow not only in academics but also emotionally and socially.India Today Education DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 9, 2025 19:16 ISTIn ShortCBSE mandates daily positive affirmations in school assembliesNew rule aims to boost students’ emotional and mental well-beingAffirmations to be age-appropriate, in both English and HindiIn a move aimed at strengthening students’ mental well-being and socio-emotional development, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has directed all affiliated schools to include daily positive affirmations during their morning assemblies from the academic session 2025–26.The decision is in line with CBSE’s broader goal of promoting holistic development in students, ensuring that they grow not only in academics but also emotionally and socially.advertisementAccording to the board, positive affirmations help students build a healthy self-image, emotional strength, and a mindset geared towards growth and stability. “Regular practice of affirmations has been shown to improve focus, confidence, and mental well-being. Our aim is to help students begin their day with clarity and calmness,” the board noted in its advisory.SIMPLE PHRASES FOR HEALTH AND SELF-REGULATION TO BE USEDSchools have been encouraged to introduce 1–2 affirmations each morning, using simple phrases that reflect respect, health, and self-regulation. These affirmations will be age-appropriate and may be customised to reflect the values of individual schools.Some sample affirmations shared by CBSE include:“I am always happy.”“I am calm and stable in every situation.”“I respect everyone. I respect nature.”“I use gadgets only for studying.”Each affirmation will be recited in both English and Hindi, to ensure understanding and inclusivity.advertisementCBSE also encourages schools to involve students in the process by allowing them to participate in creating or leading the affirmations. Schools are free to adjust the format to suit their assembly schedules and may innovate further as needed.This initiative is expected to create a more respectful and supportive school environment, helping students manage their emotions and build resilience from an early age.Published By: Rishab ChauhanPublished On: May 9, 2025 Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchOp Sindoor: Parents reveal inspiring journey of Wing Commander pilot Vyomika SinghOp Sindoor: The moment missiles flew over Jammu11 houses destroyed in Pak's artillery attack on Rajouri's Karaiya village | Ground reportGround Report: Pakistani shelling damages homes along Line of Control in RajouriMehbooba Mufti in tears, says 'pained by killings of children on both sides'AdvertisementRead ThisCBSE advises schools to include positive affirmations in morning assemblyWhen Kashmiris foiled Pak's villainous plan to snatch J&K with mujahideenWhy Galaxy S25 Edge is the most exciting Samsung phone in yearsCanada cops arrest 3 Indian-origin gangsters, see trend of South-Asian targetsIPL 2025: Bomb threat at Arun Jaitley stadium declared hoax, security increasedAdvertisement",,[],www.indiatoday.in,2025-05-11T18:16:45.195,527,['central'],sign inedition ininushome tvlive tvprimetimemagazinelatest editioninsightbest collegeslifestyleindiasouthglobalall world newsus newscanada newsuk newschina newsindians abroadbusinessall sportsipl 2025cricketfootballsports todaytennistechnologyshowbuzzentertainmentbollywoodhollywoodtelevisionottlatest reviewsnewspresso specialspodcastsfirst thing fastsunday specialhistory itnewsmodiuinteractivesopiniongamesvideosshort videosfact check newseducationits viralsciencehealthautolaw todayenvironmentcitiesweatherweb storieshoroscopesdownload appfollow u newseducation todaynewscbse advises school include positive affirmation morning assemblycbse advises school include positive affirmation morning assemblyin step aimed supporting student mental health cbse asked affiliated school start morning assembly simple positive affirmation 2025–26 academic year listen storylive tvshareadvertisementthe decision line cbse ’ broader goal promoting holistic development student ensuring grow academic also emotionally sociallyindia today education desknew delhiupdated may 9 2025 1916 istin shortcbse mandate daily positive affirmation school assembliesnew rule aim boost student ’ emotional mental wellbeingaffirmations ageappropriate english hindiin move aimed strengthening student ’ mental wellbeing socioemotional development central board secondary education cbse directed affiliated school include daily positive affirmation morning assembly academic session 2025–26the decision line cbse ’ broader goal promoting holistic development student ensuring grow academic also emotionally sociallyadvertisementaccording board positive affirmation help student build healthy selfimage emotional strength mindset geared towards growth stability “ regular practice affirmation shown improve focus confidence mental wellbeing aim help student begin day clarity calmness ” board noted advisorysimple phrase health selfregulation usedschools encouraged introduce 1–2 affirmation morning using simple phrase reflect respect health selfregulation affirmation ageappropriate may customised reflect value individual schoolssome sample affirmation shared cbse include “ always happy ” “ calm stable every situation ” “ respect everyone respect nature ” “ use gadget studying ” affirmation recited english hindi ensure understanding inclusivityadvertisementcbse also encourages school involve student process allowing participate creating leading affirmation school free adjust format suit assembly schedule may innovate neededthis initiative expected create respectful supportive school environment helping student manage emotion build resilience early agepublished rishab chauhanpublished may 9 2025 watch live tv advertisementalso watchop sindoor parent reveal inspiring journey wing commander pilot vyomika singhop sindoor moment missile flew jammu11 house destroyed paks artillery attack rajouris karaiya village ground reportground report pakistani shelling damage home along line control rajourimehbooba mufti tear say pained killing child sidesadvertisementread thiscbse advises school include positive affirmation morning assemblywhen kashmiri foiled paks villainous plan snatch jk mujahideenwhy galaxy s25 edge exciting samsung phone yearscanada cop arrest 3 indianorigin gangster see trend southasian targetsipl 2025 bomb threat arun jaitley stadium declared hoax security increasedadvertisement,positive,0.11969696969697

Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's gravitas and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi's firepower could prove to be India's best shot at reclaiming the global narrative.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementPM Narendra Modi can draft Shashi Tharoor and Asaduddin Owaisi for national duty, while they remain on opposition benches.Kamlesh SinghNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 11, 2025 14:36 ISTIn 1971, as India grappled with the East Pakistan crisis, PM Indira Gandhi sent her fiercest rival, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to the United Nations. The Jana Sangh titan's oratory gave India's cause unassailable global heft, proving a fractious democracy could unite against external threats. Today, in 2025, with a fragile ceasefire halting the latest India-Pakistan war, the battlefield has shifted from airbases to airwaves. And, India is losing ground.advertisementThe ceasefire, announced yesterday, paused hostilities sparked by the horrific Pahalgam massacre, where 26 tourists were massacred by Pakistan-backed jihadis. India's response: hitting the known terrorist bases in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan proper's Punjab. Pakistan escalated and sent barrages of missiles and swarms of drones into India. India retaliated by obliterating Pakistan's main airbases, pounding their military into paralysis.Yet, Pakistani PM Shahbaz Sharif, with audacious gall, claims victory. His narrative -- amplified by Pakistan's slick PR machine -- paints India as the aggressor, conveniently sidestepping the terrorist bloodbath that ignited the war. The world, it seems, is buying it. Pakistan, despite its crippled defences, is winning the narrative war. Before the ceasefire, the international media -- CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera -- barely blinked when Pakistan shelled Indian villages or sent drone swarms across our borders nightly. India's precise strikes on terrorist hubs like Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, however, were framed as escalations. Now, post-ceasefire, the same outlets laud Pakistan's ""restraint"" while scrutinising India's ""militarism"".advertisementPakistani ""experts"" with polished Western accents dominate global panels, peddling victimhood in the face of a ""hegemon"". The Pahalgam atrocity fades into a footnote, while Pakistan's well-funded US lobbyists and dual-citizenship brigade spin tales of a plucky underdog. Even the grotesque spectacle of Pakistani Army officers showering rose petals at terrorists' funerals hasn't dented their narrative. As Daniel Pearl's father poignantly asked, ""Who is Pakistan mourning?"" India's envoys tried, flashing these shameful images on global TV. The world shrugged.India's military dominance is undisputed, but narrative wars demand sharper weapons. Enter Shashi Tharoor and Asaduddin Owaisi -- Gravitas and Serendipitas.Tharoor, the former UN diplomat, is a rhetorical colossus whose global stature and literary fame can outmatch any Pakistani apologist on international airwaves. His Oxford-honed eloquence can dismantle Pakistan's post-ceasefire mirage, exposing their terrorist patronage with surgical precision. He's the suave, cosmopolitan face India needs to reclaim the narrative, reminding the world that ceasefire or not, Pakistan's military-jihad complex remains a global menace.Owaisi, the Cambridge-trained barrister, is the wildcard. Often divisive domestically, he's proven to be a fierce unifier against external threats. When Pakistan tried to exploit India's fault lines, Owaisi's impassioned calls for communal peace kept the nation steady. As a Muslim leader and ideological foil to the BJP, his voice carries unique weight. Deploy him on a global blitz -- Washington, Brussels, London, and so on -- where he can argue with diplomats, school media, and confront influential world leaders with Pakistan's grim reality: a state hijacked by jihad-obsessed generals who've spilt innocent blood for a delusional expansionist fantasy, only to claim victory when battered into a ceasefire. This would also send a signal to the warring fringes at home.advertisementUnleashing Tharoor and Owaisi wouldn't be just strategic; it would be a masterstroke of optics. It would signal to Pakistan -- and the world -- that India's political spectrum, from saffron to green, stands united. It's a defiant strike at Western narrative mills, proving India isn't just a military juggernaut but a cohesive democracy, impossible to caricature as the bully just because Pakistan is a smaller, stunted stature state.Some BJP stalwarts might baulk at sharing the stage, but national interest trumps party egos. If Indira Gandhi could trust Vajpayee, Narendra Modi can bank on Tharoor's finesse and Owaisi's fire.The ceasefire hasn't ended the war; it's merely shifted the terrain. Pakistan's narrative, polished by decades of duplicity, threatens to overshadow India's truth. If Operation Sindoor has taken Kashmir out of the centre of any India-Pakistan hostility, the ceasefire has brought the hyphen back into the world's imagination of the subcontinent. India had moved leagues ahead, but after May 10, 2025, the world will see us as sparring equals who need a third party to sit down.Tharoor and Owaisi can flip the script, forcing the world to see Pakistan's terrorist pageants and drone swarms, not just India's righteous might. Prime Minister Modi should make the call: draft Shashi Tharoor and Asaduddin Owaisi for national duty, while they remain on opposition benches. A ceasefire is just a pause in a long war. That's for the sharpest minds in the military to prepare for and execute. The narrative war too needs our sharpest minds leading the charge.Published By: Sushim MukulPublished On: May 11, 2025Tune InMust Watch Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchBrahMos missile booster

He attributes his decision to prior commitments and concerns about age-drafting for another project.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementNeil Nitin Mukesh regrets turning down Rahul Bose's role in Berlin.Anita BrittoMumbai,UPDATED: May 7, 2025 13:41 ISTIn ShortNeil Nitin Mukesh regrets not taking the role of Sondhi in 'Berlin', played by Rahul BoseHe missed the opportunity due to commitments to other projects and age-drafting concernsNeil praises the performances in 'Berlin'Actor Neil Nitin Mukesh recently opened up about passing on a role he now deeply wishes he had taken up. The role in question was that of Sondhi from Atul Sabharwal’s acclaimed 2023 film, 'Berlin'. The actor, known for his intense performances, candidly shared how watching the film left him with a sense of missed opportunity.During a conversation with India Today Digital, Neil was asked about one role he regrets rejecting. ""You know, I recently saw 'Berlin'. And that’s the only film that I wish I had done,"" Neil admitted. ""Because I didn’t see the potential of the character. And after seeing it, I felt that I lost the chance of working with who I consider a fine filmmaker as well - Atul sir.""advertisementThe role in question was that of Sondhi, which was eventually played by Rahul Bose. Neil revealed that it had been offered to him by casting director Mayank Bawa. ""He is like a brother to me, and he offered me a role in 'Berlin'. Unfortunately, I didn't take up the role. But I think Aparshakti Khurana and all the other actors were brilliant."" Explaining why he turned down the part, Neil said, ""I was offered Rahul's role. And at that point, I was already doing 'Hisaab Barabaar'. There was a certain concern about age-drafting because I was also doing 'Hai Junoon', and I needed to cut the age for that, and for 'Berlin', I had to be a little more mature. So I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to do both parallelly.""advertisementHere is the trailer of 'Hai Junoon': He added, ""So that’s the only reason why I couldn’t be a part of that film. But when I saw the film, I really enjoyed the film and wished I had done that.""Neil Nitin Mukesh will be sharing the screen with Boman Irani and Jacqueline Fernandez, along with Sumedh Mudgalkar, Siddharth Nigam, and Priyank Sharma.

The Saif Ali Khan and Jaideep Ahlawat-starrer is not even all style, no meat. It's worse than that. Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementNetflix film 'Jewel Thief: The Heist Begins' review (Photo: Movie still/ India Today)Vineeta KumarNew Delhi,UPDATED: Apr 25, 2025 17:05 ISTIn Short'Jewel Thief: The Heist Begins' lacks the thrill and unpredictability of a heist filmSaif Ali Khan and Jaideep Ahlawat deliver decent performancesThe film suffers from a weak script and cliched plotCast & CrewSaif Ali KhanJaideep AhlawatKunal Kapur Celebrity chef and restaurateurRating: Release Date: 25 Apr, 2025Heist thrillers are engaging. Watching them is like playing a game. There's a set formula, and one rule: do not lose. In Netflix's 'Jewel Thief: The Heist Begins', no formula seems to be working, though.A gangster-businessman, Rajan (Jaideep Ahlawat), hires a con-artiste and thief, Rehan Roy, (Saif Ali Khan) to steal one of the most expensive diamonds in the world - The Red Sun. Rajan uses Rehan's father as the bait to ensure that he's not playing him. We see cop Vikram Patel (Kunal Kapoor) unsuccessfully chasing Rehan for years, and Farrah (Nikita Dutta) playing the distressed wife, trapped in a love-less, forced marriage with Rajan.advertisementThe recipe for making a decent heist thriller is clear: make it fast-paced, add a few out-of-syllabus twists and make it as unpredictable as it can get - all of which is missing from 'Jewel Thief'. The film looks like a lazy idea, something the industry roasted, fried and burnt ages back. Stealing a diamond is not a big deal. Diamonds exist to be stolen in our Bollywood universe, but the same nuances need a better push, a refreshing change when adapting the narrative for OTT.In 'Jewel Thief', everybody is making defeating efforts to pull off a poorly-written script. Saif looks stylish, throws his usual I-know-what-I-am-doing swag around, and gets the work done. Even Jaideep Ahlawat is fantastic as this rogue, ruthless businessman; when is he not? But, the casting and the performances are not a problem. It's the film itself.advertisement You know how they say that some stories are better left untouched. Well, 'Jewel Thief' is that story. It didn't need to be made. It is fine if you think that not every story, not every film, needs to bring something new to the table, but this film ruins your idea of even a basic, formulaic cinema. There's song, action, a foreign location, stunning cast members, a few kisses thrown here and there, but all in the absence of one thing that combines it all - a story.It almost seems like after a point, everyone gives up, introduces their own twists in the narrative, and simply rushes to end the film. 'Jewel Thief' plays on a genre-shifting narrative and not in quite an impressive way. The chemistry between Saif and Nikita looks dry. Top it up with probably the most out-of-place lip kiss in the history of Bollywood and you get a pairing that is absolutely unsellable.'Jewel Thief' doesn't only lack a good climax, but also a decent beginning and a gripping middle. It defies all logic - something given when it's a film by Siddharth Anand ('Fighter', 'Pathaan', 'War', 'Bang Bang'). At this point, you can't even complain when a film by Anand is making a fool of the authorities, the security agencies and the government. But, the mistakes in 'Jewel Thief' are so glaring that there's no sweet safe spot here. The scale of the film is grand - in the sense that it is partially set in Budapest. But, does shooting at a foreign location validate a film's style and scale?advertisement Lazy dialogues and casual racism further make the film a bitter experience. At its worst, it could have been all style and no meat, but it doesn't qualify to be that either. The film fails to do the bare minimum for the audience, let alone provide a 100 per cent immersive, entertaining experience.'Jewel Thief: The Heist Begins', directed by Robbie Grewal and Kookie Gulati, is the plane that should have never taken off, and now it is bound to crash.

Currently, in its tenth week, the film has crossed the Rs 600 crore mark, nett, on its 66th day, becoming the third Hindi film to achieve this milestone after 'Pushpa 2' and 'Stree 2'. However, unlike the other two, 'Chhaava' has reached this figure purely on the strength of its content, performances, and narrative, and did not benefit from the hype that the first part generated.advertisementThe film, which celebrates the bravery of Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, has earned Rs 600.10 crore on its 66th day. Despite its availability on Netflix, the audience seems to be watching the film in theatres. Watch this monologue from 'Chhaava' here: 'Chhaava' opened to a blockbuster response, earning Rs 225.28 crore in its first week and maintained strong momentum with Rs 186.18 crore in the second week.Upon its Netflix release, the film ranked fifth in the non-English film category, indicating its broad appeal.

(Photo: Reuters)India Today World DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 11, 2025 16:31 ISTWritten By: Vivek KumarIn ShortPope Leo hopes for lasting peace between nuclear neighboursUS mediation led to ceasefire effective May 10, but Pak violated itPope appeals for global peace and aid in Ukraine and Gaza crisesPope Leo XIV, US Cardinal Robert Prevost, on Sunday welcomed the ceasefire between India and Pakistan following three days of military conflict after India launched Operation Sindoor strikes against terror infrastructure inside Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.Pope Leo said he was glad to hear of the truce and hoped negotiations would lead to a lasting accord between the nuclear-armed neighbours.He also appealed to the world's other major powers for ""no more war"" in his first Sunday message to crowds in St Peter's Square since his election as the 267th Pope.advertisement Cardinal Prevost was elected in a surprise choice to be the new leader of the Catholic Church on Thursday, taking the name Leo XIV, becoming the first American pontiff.The newly elected Pope's reaction came a day after India and Pakistan reached an understanding on stopping fire, but the latter broke the truce and resorted to heavy shelling in India's bordering towns from Jammu and Kashmir to Gujarat.On Saturday evening, US President Donald Trump announced that, following the mediation by his administration, both India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, coming into effect from 5 pm on May 10. However, the Pakistani Army violated the ceasefire and opened artillery fire on the Indian territory.The hostilities between the two neighbouring nations began after the Pahalgam attack, which claimed 26 civilian lives when Pakistan-backed terrorists opened fire on tourists in the Baisaran Valley on April 22. Following that, India suspended the Indus Water Treaty, downgraded diplomatic ties, banned Pakistani nationals, called off bilateral trade and closed its airspace for Pakistani flights, among a host of retaliatory measures.POPE'S MESSAGE OF PEACEadvertisementIn his first Sunday message to crowds in Vatican City's St Peter's Square since his election as pontiff, Pope Leo said, ""Today's world is living through the dramatic scenario of a Third World War being fought piecemeal"".The US Cardinal also said he felt for the ""suffering of the beloved people of Ukraine."" He appealed for negotiations to reach an ""authentic, just and lasting peace.""He also said he was ""profoundly saddened"" by the Gaza war and urged parties for an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid and the release of the remaining hostages held by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.Published By: Poorva JoshiPublished On: May 11, 2025Trending Reel Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchBrahMos missile booster found in Bikaner, hinting at potential use against PakistanLittle girl dresses as Rani Lakshmi Bai with baby on her back, wins hearts onlineIAF: Operation Sindoor Continues With Precision, Aligned With National ObjectivesRajouri residents return to normalcy after ceasefire between India-PakistanIndia-Pak ceasefire: Who is Commodore Nair?AdvertisementRead This'If they attack, we will attack stronger', PM told Vance on ceasefire with Pak: Government sourcesNo pressure on Australian players to return to IPL as CA offers help: ReportsTendulkar's heartwarming message on Mother's Day: All started with her prayersSatellite image shows damage to Pak's Nur Khan air base in Indian strikeSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge to launch in 2 days: What to expectAdvertisement",,[],www.indiatoday.in,2025-05-11T18:17:19.224,632,"['government', 'pm', 'election']",sign inedition ininushome tvlive tvprimetimemagazinelatest editioninsightbest collegeslifestyleindiasouthglobalall world newsus newscanada newsuk newschina newsindians abroadbusinessall sportsipl 2025cricketfootballsports todaytennistechnologyshowbuzzentertainmentbollywoodhollywoodtelevisionottlatest reviewsnewspresso specialspodcastsfirst thing fastsunday specialhistory itnewsmodiuinteractivesopiniongamesvideosshort videosfact check newseducationits viralsciencehealthautolaw todayenvironmentcitiesweatherweb storieshoroscopesdownload appfollow u newsworldpope leo welcome indiapakistan ceasefire deal hope lasting peacepope leo welcome indiapakistan ceasefire deal hope lasting peacehe also appealed world major power war first sunday message crowd st peter square since election 267th popelisten storylive tvshareadvertisementnewly elected pope leo xiv cardinal robert prevost united state appears balcony st peter basilica photo reutersindia today world desknew delhiupdated may 11 2025 1631 istwritten vivek kumarin shortpope leo hope lasting peace nuclear neighboursus mediation led ceasefire effective may 10 pak violated itpope appeal global peace aid ukraine gaza crisespope leo xiv u cardinal robert prevost sunday welcomed ceasefire india pakistan following three day military conflict india launched operation sindoor strike terror infrastructure inside pakistan pakistanoccupied kashmirpope leo said glad hear truce hoped negotiation would lead lasting accord nucleararmed neighbourshe also appealed world major power war first sunday message crowd st peter square since election 267th popeadvertisement cardinal prevost elected surprise choice new leader catholic church thursday taking name leo xiv becoming first american pontiffthe newly elected pope reaction came day india pakistan reached understanding stopping fire latter broke truce resorted heavy shelling india bordering town jammu kashmir gujaraton saturday evening u president donald trump announced following mediation administration india pakistan agreed ceasefire coming effect 5 pm may 10 however pakistani army violated ceasefire opened artillery fire indian territorythe hostility two neighbouring nation began pahalgam attack claimed 26 civilian life pakistanbacked terrorist opened fire tourist baisaran valley april 22 following india suspended indus water treaty downgraded diplomatic tie banned pakistani national called bilateral trade closed airspace pakistani flight among host retaliatory measurespopes message peaceadvertisementin first sunday message crowd vatican city st peter square since election pontiff pope leo said today world living dramatic scenario third world war fought piecemealthe u cardinal also said felt suffering beloved people ukraine appealed negotiation reach authentic lasting peacehe also said profoundly saddened gaza war urged party immediate ceasefire humanitarian aid release remaining hostage held palestinian militant group hamaspublished poorva joshipublished may 11 2025trending reel watch live tv advertisementalso watchbrahmos missile booster found bikaner hinting potential use pakistanlittle girl dress rani lakshmi bai baby back win heart onlineiaf operation sindoor continues precision aligned national objectivesrajouri resident return normalcy ceasefire indiapakistanindiapak ceasefire commodore nairadvertisementread thisif attack attack stronger pm told vance ceasefire pak government sourcesno pressure australian player return ipl ca offer help reportstendulkars heartwarming message mother day started prayerssatellite image show damage paks nur khan air base indian strikesamsung galaxy s25 edge launch 2 day expectadvertisement,positive,0.131643356643357

Now, Sunita spoke to the media to clarify the rumours. Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementGovinda's wife Sunita Ahuja on divorce rumours (Photo: Instagram/ Sunita Ahuja)India Today Entertainment DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 11, 2025 16:05 ISTIn ShortSunita Ahuja denied divorce rumours about her and GovindaShe emphasised trusting only her or Govinda in such mattersSunita expressed strong faith that Govinda wouldn't leave the family for anyoneActor Govinda's wife, Sunita Ahuja, once again opened up about the rumours of divorce. Earlier this year, Ahuja's team released a statement, denying that all was not well in their paradise. The statement, however, mentioned that she had filed for a divorce, but the couple later agreed to work on their marriage.In an interview with Times Now, Ahuja, known for her bold statements, said one should only believe either her or Govinda when it comes to rumours of their broken marriage. She said she has immense faith in her husband, and believes that he would never break their family because of 'any stupid woman'.advertisementShe said in Hindi, ""Jis din confirm hoga, ya mere aur Govinda ke muh se aap log sunoge, vo alag baat hai (Consider these rumours confirmed only when you hear it from either me or Govinda). But I don’t think Govinda can live without me, nor can I live without Govinda. And Govinda can never leave his family for any stupid person or stupid woman."" She even warned the media against spreading more rumours. Ahuja said people should come straight to her to clarify if they have anything to discuss about her marriage with Govinda.""First, ask whether it’s even true. I will never accept it, and if anyone has the courage, they should ask me directly. If anything like this ever happens, I’ll be the first to speak to the media. But I believe God will never break my home,"" she concluded.Govinda and Sunita married in 1986. However, they kept their marriage hidden for four years.

Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementDonald Trump claims India-Pakistan truce talks were held under US mediation. (Photo: Reuters, PTI)India Today News DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: May 10, 2025 22:11 ISTWritten By: Ajmal AbbasIn ShortIndia, Pak agree to surprise ceasefire after recent military clashesUS President Trump claims ceasefire result of US mediationIndia asserts truce talks held directly between both countriesIndia and Pakistan on Sunday agreed to an unexpected ceasefire after days of military action and heightened tension along the Line of Control and the International Border, following the Phalagam terrorist attack and India's retaliatory Operation Sindoor. While the US claimed that the talks were held through its mediation, India said the discussions took place directly between the two neighbours-in-conflict.It was US President Donald Trump who announced the surprise decision, even before any indication from New Delhi or Islamabad. He claimed that the ceasefire was reached ""after a long night of talks mediated by the United States"".advertisement""I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" he posted on social media. Within a minute of Trump's tweet, the White House and Vice President JD Vance also shared Turmp's post.US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, joined, saying ""Over the past 48 hours, VP Vance and I have engaged with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif"", among others. He also claimed India and Pakistan have agreed to start talks on a ""broad set of issues at a neutral site"".TRUCE TALKS HELD DIRECTLY: INDIA ASSERTSIndia, which confirmed the ceasefire at 6 pm, stated that Pakistan had initiated the talks on Saturday evening by dialling India and that the talks were held directly between the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of both countries.advertisementIn a cryptic message tagged with #IndiaFightsPropaganda, the government appeared to counter the US announcement that seemed to take credit for the truce, asserting that the ceasefire “was worked out directly between the two countries”. The post also addressed Rubio’s assertion that India and Pakistan had agreed to engage in broader dialogue.""Stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries.""Pak DGMO initiated the call this afternoon after which discussions took place and understanding reached.""No decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place,"" the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting tweeted.However, according to sources, the United States played a key role in de-escalation by exerting direct pressure on Pakistan, linking the provisional release of a $1 billion IMF loan to its immediate acceptance of the ceasefire, with the remaining amount contingent on full compliance.Furthermore, the US has officially recognised India’s revised war doctrine, which declares that any future terrorist attack will be considered an act of war.India targeted terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir recently, days after Pakistan-based terrorists killed 26 people -- mostly tourists -- in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. The Pakistani army escalated the situation further with drone and missile attacks, which were intercepted by Indian defence systems. The surprise truce came amid fears that the conflict could spiral into a broader war.Published By: Ajmal Published On: May 10, 2025Tune InTrending Reel IN THIS STORY#India-Pakistan#Pakistan#Donald TrumpWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchIndia Destroys Pakistani Drone Launch Pads Near Jammu regionExplosions Rock Chichara Village In Punjab's Gurdaspur, Leaving Massive CraterPakistan targeted Punjab airbase using high-speed missile, says governmentPakistan's Media Blackout: GHQ Directs Silence on Military DamagesPakistan targets civilians in Jammu; houses, cars damagedAdvertisementRead ThisAll well in Pakistan, the land of confusion and coups?This is how Pakistan targeted India on the internetWhy did Marta Kostyuk shake hands with ‘Russian’ Daria Kasatkina?

Advertisement Edited by: Rohit Paul India News Jun 09, 2023 14:23 pm IST Published On Jun 09, 2023 14:18 pm IST Last Updated On Jun 09, 2023 14:23 pm IST Read Time: 6 mins > The neighbour said he first noticed the smell on Monday. Mumbai: A man wearing a helmet and a mask, with only his bloodshot eyes visible - this was the sight that greeted a neighbour in his first-ever interaction with Manoj Sane, the man accused of murdering 32-year-old Saraswati Vaidya and chopping up her body in Mumbai.In an interview with NDTV, Somesh Srivastava - the neighbour who noticed the smell, confronted 56-year-old Sane and alerted the police - gave details of how Sane was caught on Wednesday evening. He spoke of how the police ensured everything looked normal so that Sane would not be spooked when he came back to the society in Mira Road's Geeta Nagar, and how Sane nearly managed to give them the slip despite this. ""We first noticed the smell on Monday. We thought that a rat must have died somewhere in the society and ignored it,"" Mr Srivastava told NDTVHe said that the stench was unbearable when he came home for lunch on Wednesday. ""I suspected something was amiss. If an animal had died in someone's house, they would have noticed and cleaned it in three days,"" Mr Srivastava said. That's when he decided to knock on the door of Sane's flat. ""There was no response initially. When I knocked again after 5-10 minutes, I could hear him spraying air freshener all over the house. The sound was quite loud and I could tell that Sane was spraying inside the room and around the door as well,"" said Mr Srivastava, adding that he stood at the door for another 10 minutes, but Sane did not answer. Advertisement On what happened when he spoke to Sane, Mr Srivastava said, ""When I finally spoke to Sane, I noticed he was shivering and his eyes were red. He had a helmet on, and a mask, and only his bloodshot eyes were visible. He left the society and I called the building secretary."" Asked what he saw when the police were contacted and he entered the flat, Mr Srivastava said, ""When the door was broken open, we went straight to the bedroom and saw a black plastic sheet covering the bed. We thought there could be a dead body beneath it, but there was nothing."" Advertisement ""A tree-cutting machine was kept next to the bed. We found nothing in the other bedroom and the washroom either. The kitchen was where we found the body parts, kept in buckets. There were bones, blood and muscles,"" he added.Asked how Sane was caught, Mr Srivastava said the flat's real estate agent, who had reached the spot, gave the police all the information that was in the rent agreement.""An hour had passed since Sane had left and the police told us not to answer too many phone calls and ensure everything looked normal, since Sane had told me he would be back by 10.30 pm. They said if Sane saw a crowd gathered in the society when he returned, he would leave. There was no police car and the cops parked their bike out of sight,"" said Mr Srivastava. The cops had reached the society at 7 pm and Sane returned around 8.30 pm. ""He used the lift and came upstairs. He saw police personnel in uniform and got scared. Sane knew he could not use the stairs to flee and, coincidentally, a constable, who was heading downstairs, had entered the lift before Sane got off,"" he added. Advertisement ""The police did not know his face and did not know it was him. The agent was the one who told the police it was Sane and that's how he was caught. Sane was trying to hide his face and go back downstairs. He would have probably fled if he had managed to do that,"" said the neighbour.When Mr Srivastava was asked whether he had spoken to either Sane or Saraswati Vaidya before, he said they would leave the house and exit the society immediately.

Advertisement > Dr. Narendra Saini from the Indian Medical Association warns that irrational use of antimicrobials in humans, crops, and the environment leads to resistance. He explains that when these powerful medicines are administered whether to humans, in agricultural practices, or even in environmental contexts microbes can rapidly adapt, resulting in drug resistance. This resistance jeopardizes effective treatment options for infections and may lead to a potential third pandemic if not addressed properly. > Ravi Bhatnagar emphasised Dettol Banega Swasth India's dedication to promoting awareness about antimicrobial resistance (AMR). He said, ""Dettol #BanegaSwasthIndia is committed to integrating AMR awareness into our existing hygiene programs. We understand the importance of educating from a young age, so we're developing child-friendly resources, conducting behavioral research, and will look into using local languages to spread the message. Ultimately, we must emphasise the importance of personal hygiene and responsible antibiotic use, working together to safeguard our future."" > Dr. Neelam Kler warns that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in neonatal sepsis causes 60,000 deaths annually, with treatment costs for AMR infections significantly higher, increasing financial burdens.

She said, ""School can contribute to spreading awareness because we have a larger impact. In case of AMR, it requires a behavioural change. Hence, it is important we talk to children about hygiene, especially handwashing."" > According to WHO, ""Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the top global public health and development threats.
